# Privacy Policy for PillPal

**Last Updated: February 5, 2026**

## Overview

PillPal is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.

**The Short Version:** We don't collect, store, or share any of your personal information. Everything stays on your device.

---

## Information Collection and Use

### What We Collect

**Nothing.** PillPal does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.

All data you enter into PillPal (medication names, schedules, dose logs, notes) is stored **locally on your device only** using iOS's built-in secure storage.

### What We Don't Collect

- No account registration required
- No email addresses
- No names or personal identifiers
- No health information transmitted to servers
- No usage analytics or tracking
- No advertising IDs
- No location data
- No contact information

---

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All medication data is stored exclusively on your device using:
- **SwiftData** - Apple's secure local database framework
- **iOS Keychain** (if applicable for sensitive data)
- No cloud synchronization (unless you enable iCloud in future versions)

### Your Control

You have complete control over your data:
- **Export**: You can export your medication history as a PDF at any time
- **Delete**: Deleting the app removes all data permanently from your device
- **No Backup**: We don't back up your data to our servers (your device's iCloud backup may include app data if you have that enabled)

---

## Permissions

### Notifications

PillPal requests permission to send you **local notifications** (medication reminders). These notifications:
- Are generated entirely on your device
- Are not sent through external servers
- Contain only information you've entered (medication names and times)
- Can be disabled at any time in iOS Settings

### No Other Permissions Required

PillPal does not request or require:
- Camera access
- Photo library access
- Location services
- Contacts access
- Microphone access
- Health app integration (at this time)

---

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data with anyone.** Period.

- No third-party analytics services
- No advertising networks
- No data brokers
- No cloud services (unless you opt into iCloud sync in future versions)
- No government or law enforcement access (because we don't have your data)

### PDF Exports

When you export your medication history as a PDF:
- The PDF is generated on your device
- The file remains on your device in your Files app
- You control who you share it with (doctors, family, etc.)
- We never see or receive these exports

---

## Security

### Your Data is Secure

- All data is stored using iOS's secure storage mechanisms
- No data transmission to external servers means no interception risk
- Standard iOS security protections apply (device passcode, Face ID, etc.)

### Best Practices

We recommend:
- Use a strong device passcode
- Keep iOS updated to the latest version
- Don't share your device with untrusted individuals

---

## Children's Privacy

PillPal does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since all data stays on the device, there is no transmission of information that would require parental consent.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted:
- In the app (via update notes)
- On our website (if applicable)
- The "Last Updated" date at the top will reflect changes

Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

---

## Third-Party Services

### Current: None

PillPal currently does not integrate with any third-party services.

### Future Considerations

If we add optional features in the future (such as iCloud sync, caregiver sharing, or health app integration), we will:
- Make them **opt-in only**
- Update this privacy policy before launch
- Notify users of changes
- Clearly explain what data is shared and why

---

## Your Rights

### Data Access

You have full access to all your data at any time through the app interface.

### Data Deletion

To delete your data:
1. **Delete specific medications**: Swipe left in the app
2. **Delete all data**: Delete the PillPal app from your device

### Data Portability

Export your data at any time via the PDF export feature.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have specific rights. However, since PillPal:
- Does not collect personal information
- Does not sell personal information
- Does not share personal information with third parties

Most CCPA provisions do not apply. You have complete control over your local device data.

---

## European Users (GDPR)

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), EU residents have specific rights. However, since PillPal:
